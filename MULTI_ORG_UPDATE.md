# Multi-Organization System Implementation

## üéØ Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-organization system where 200 causes are distributed across 8 different NGOs instead of being owned by a single organization.

## ‚úÖ What Was Changed

### 1. Database Seeding (`impactmatch/data/seed.js`)

**Added 5 New NGO Organizations:**
- **Health for All** (Chennai) - Healthcare services
- **Animal Rescue Society** (Pune) - Animal welfare
- **Tech for Good** (Hyderabad) - Digital literacy
- **Arts & Culture Foundation** (Kolkata) - Arts and heritage
- **Community Sports League** (Ahmedabad) - Youth sports

**Total NGOs: 8** (previously 3)
- ImpactMatch Foundation (Bangalore)
- Green Earth NGO (Delhi)
- Hope Foundation (Mumbai)
- Health for All (Chennai)
- Animal Rescue Society (Pune)
- Tech for Good (Hyderabad)
- Arts & Culture Foundation (Kolkata)
- Community Sports League (Ahmedabad)

**Cause Distribution:**
- 200 causes evenly distributed: ~25 causes per NGO
- Each cause now has `ngoId` field pointing to its owning organization
- Automatic distribution algorithm in seed script

### 2. API Routes (`impactmatch/routes/causeRoutes.js`)

**Updated GET /api/causes:**
- Now populates `ngoId` with NGO details (name, email, city)
- Causes returned with organization information for display

### 3. Frontend - Swipe Page (`client/src/components/SwipePage.jsx`)

**Enhanced Cause Display:**
- Shows NGO organization name for each cause
- Proper formatting of cause data from API
- Fixed match creation to use `/api/matches` endpoint
- Better error handling for duplicate matches

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Each cause now shows:
organization: cause.ngoId?.name || 'Unknown Organization'
```

### 4. Frontend - User Dashboard (`client/src/components/dashboards/user/MyCauses.jsx`)

**Updated "My Causes" Page:**
- Displays NGO organization name for each joined cause
- Shows which organization posted each cause
- Proper data mapping from cause.ngoId.name

**Visual Enhancement:**
- Heart icon + NGO name displayed prominently
- Location, join date, and category all visible
- Verification status clearly shown

### 5. Frontend - NGO Dashboard (Already Working)

**VolunteerVerification.jsx:**
- Already filters matches by NGO's causes
- Only shows volunteers who swiped on THIS NGO's causes
- No changes needed - architecture was already correct!

## üîÑ Complete Flow (How It Works)

### User Swipes Right:
1. User sees cause card with NGO name (e.g., "Health for All")
2. User swipes right on a cause
3. **Match Created:** `POST /api/matches` with userId + causeId
4. Match stored in database with reference to specific cause
5. Success toast: "Matched with [Cause Name]!"

### User Dashboard:
1. User navigates to "My Causes"
2. Fetches all matches for logged-in user
3. Enriches matches with cause details and NGO name
4. Displays list showing:
   - Cause title and description
   - **NGO Organization name** (from cause.ngoId.name)
   - Location, date joined, category
   - Status: Pending or Verified

### NGO Dashboard:
1. NGO logs in (e.g., ngo@healthforall.org)
2. Navigates to "Verify Volunteers"
3. System fetches:
   - All causes posted by THIS NGO
   - All matches where causeId matches NGO's causes
4. NGO sees ONLY volunteers who swiped on THEIR causes
5. NGO can verify attendance ‚Üí creates verification record
6. Verification synced to user's dashboard
