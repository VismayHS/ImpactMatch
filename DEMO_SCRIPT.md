## ❓ FAQ - Be Prepared to Answer

### Q: How accurate is your AI matching?
**A:** "We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithms to analyze user interests and cause descriptions. The more specific users are with their interests, the better our matches. We're also collecting data to improve recommendations over time."

### Q: Why blockchain?  
**A:** "Blockchain solves the trust problem in impact verification. Volunteers can prove their contributions, NGOs can verify them without centralized control, and employers or universities can independently verify a volunteer's impact record."

### Q: What's the cost/business model?
**A:** "We're exploring several models: freemium (basic free, premium features for NGOs), sponsorships from corporations doing CSR, and potentially transaction fees for large enterprise integrations. Our goal is to keep the core platform free for individual volunteers."

### Q: How do you prevent fraud?
**A:** "Multiple layers: NGO verification by admin before they can verify volunteers, blockchain immutability prevents record tampering, activity logging tracks suspicious patterns, and our matching algorithm identifies anomalies in behavior."

### Q: Can this scale globally?
**A:** "Absolutely. Our architecture is designed for horizontal scaling. The AI matching is language-agnostic (can be adapted), MongoDB scales well, and blockchain is inherently distributed. We'd deploy region-specific instances with shared blockchain."

### Q: What about users without crypto knowledge?
**A:** "That's the beauty - they don't need any! The blockchain runs completely in the background. Users just click 'join cause' and 'verify contribution.' We handle all the wallet management and transactions automatically."
