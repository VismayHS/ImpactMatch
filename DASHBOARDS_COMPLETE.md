### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/users` - Fetch all users (with role filtering)
- `GET /api/causes` - Fetch all causes
- `GET /api/matches` - Fetch volunteer joins
- `GET /api/verifications` - Fetch blockchain proofs
- `POST /api/matches` - Join a cause
- `POST /api/verifications` - Create blockchain proof
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user/NGO (approve, suspend)
- `PUT /api/causes/:id` - Update cause (flag, status)

- `DELETE /api/causes/:id` - Remove cause

### Design Pattern
- **Glassmorphism UI**: `bg-white/50 backdrop-blur-lg` throughout
- **Gradient Headers**: Blue/purple/pink gradients for visual hierarchy
- **Consistent Error Handling**: try-catch blocks with toast notifications
- **Loading States**: Spinner animations during data fetch
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
