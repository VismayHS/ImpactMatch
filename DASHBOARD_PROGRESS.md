## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Login Flow:
```bash
# User Login
Email: vismay@example.com
Password: demo123
Expected: → /user-dashboard

# Admin Login  
Email: admin@impactmatch.com
Password: admin123
Expected: → /admin-dashboard

# NGO Login (register new NGO)
Register as NGO with certificate
Expected: → / (home) then login → /ngo-dashboard
```

### 2. Check Dashboard Access:
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/user-dashboard
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ngo-dashboard  
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard
- All should show premium layouts with sidebars

### 3. Verify Navigation:
- Click sidebar menu items
- URLs should change (e.g., /ngo-dashboard/add-cause)
- Placeholder content should appear

## 💡 Development Strategy

Given the massive scope, I recommend **incremental builds**:

### Option A: Vertical Slice (One Dashboard at a Time)
- Complete ALL pages for User Dashboard first
- Then complete ALL pages for NGO Dashboard
- Finally complete ALL pages for Admin Dashboard

### Option B: Horizontal Slice (Feature by Feature)
- Build all "Overview" pages for all 3 dashboards
- Build all "Management" pages
- Build all "Analytics" pages

### Option C: Critical Path (Priority Features)
- User Discover + My Causes (core user flow)
- NGO Add Cause + Verify Volunteers (core NGO flow)
- Admin NGO Management (core admin flow)

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option C** to get a working MVP quickly.
